# ENVIRONMENT

Written by Dex. Do not edit: Dex rewrites this file whenever the project's service list changes.

How this project's code reaches its backing services. Every connection setting is an environment variable named below. The sandbox provides the values (the deployment does in production); never write a value into code, tests, config files or this repository.

Check every connection from the app's own code:

```sh
backend/.venv/bin/python backend/scripts/check_connections.py
```

## PostgreSQL

The app's relational database.

| Variable | Holds |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLAlchemy URL of the database, password included |

```python
import os

from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text

engine = create_engine(os.environ["DATABASE_URL"], pool_pre_ping=True)
with engine.connect() as conn:
    conn.execute(text("SELECT 1"))
```

Tests use the real PostgreSQL the sandbox runs (same `DATABASE_URL`); no mocks, no SQLite stand-in.

## pgvector (vectors in PostgreSQL)

Vector columns and similarity search in the same PostgreSQL database; the `vector` extension is already created.

| Variable | Holds |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | SQLAlchemy URL of the database, password included |

```python
import os

from pgvector.sqlalchemy import Vector
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase

engine = create_engine(os.environ["DATABASE_URL"], pool_pre_ping=True)


class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass


class Item(Base):
    __tablename__ = "items"
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    embedding = Column(Vector(1536))
```

Tests use the real PostgreSQL with `vector` the sandbox runs; no mocks.

## Redis

Cache and/or queue broker.

| Variable | Holds |
|---|---|
| `REDIS_URL` | redis:// URL of the server, including the database number |

```python
import os

import redis

client = redis.from_url(os.environ["REDIS_URL"])
client.set("greeting", "hello", ex=60)
```

Tests use the real Redis the sandbox runs (same `REDIS_URL`); no mocks.

## Amazon S3

File storage in AWS; in the sandbox a private test bucket emptied at each sprint.

| Variable | Holds |
|---|---|
| `S3_BUCKET` | the bucket to use |
| `AWS_REGION` | the bucket's region |
| `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | short-lived access key |
| `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | short-lived secret key |
| `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` | the session token that goes with them |

```python
import os

import boto3
from botocore.config import Config

endpoint = os.environ.get("S3_ENDPOINT_URL") or None  # set for MinIO, unset for AWS S3
s3 = boto3.client(
    "s3",
    region_name=os.environ["AWS_REGION"],
    endpoint_url=endpoint,
    config=Config(s3={"addressing_style": "path"}) if endpoint else None,
)  # credentials come from the AWS_* variables automatically
bucket = os.environ["S3_BUCKET"]
s3.put_object(Bucket=bucket, Key="example.txt", Body=b"hello")
```

Tests use the real test bucket (same variables); no mocks, no moto. The keys are short-lived: let boto3 read them from the environment, never copy them.
